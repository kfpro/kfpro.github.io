Hello World!
This is Farhan! I am a student currently pursueing Electrical Engineering at IEM Kolkata.
I'm a person who views coding from a different perspective... And more importantly, enjoys it!
I'm a Junior Data Scientist who excels at Data Wrangling, Machine Learning, Exploratory Analysis, and Data Visualizations.


Hello, my name is Natassha Selvaraj. I am currently pursuing a computer science degree, and I major in data science. I have worked on a variety of data projects, which include data analysis, visualization, and implementing machine learning pipelines. I will showcase some of my projects here, and link them to their GitHub repositories.

During my free time, I like to write and code. I enjoy working on HackerRank challenges, which help sharpen my mind and improve on my problem solving skills.

When I'm not coding, I write on Medium. I like telling data stories around the data science projects that I do. I am currently a writer in publications such as The Startup, Better Programming, Towards Data Science, Level Up Coding, and Data Driven Investor.

I stand by the quote "If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it well enough." I make it a point to set aside some time to create simple tutorials on a variety of data science tools. These tutorials are aimed towards beginners just starting out in the field. I have added links to some of my tutorials here.

<br><br><br>
I love technology and something new <br>
I believe that people should be curious, passionate, <br>
and explore the unknown to make our lives meaningful.

I learned how to code with different online and offline courses, StackOverflow and trial and error. Each project teaches me new skills. Below are some of the stages of my learning path and the skills I aquired.
